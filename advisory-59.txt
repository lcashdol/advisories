   Description: InstallAnywhere (www.zerog.com) is a software framework
   that simplifies software installation on multiple client and server
   platforms. This software is utilized by such vendors like LimeWire
   (www.limewire.org). During execution this software insecurely creates
   two file in /tmp that can be used to clobber system files through
   symlink attacks. During the creation of one file a race condition
   exists to determine the filename the other requires no guesswork.
   Vulnerability:
   I noticed InstallAnywhere creates the following files in /tmp:
   persistent_state env.properties.NNNNN Where NNNNN is the current
   process id or ($$) These files can be used to clobber system files if
   the installation software is run as root. A malicious attacker can
   create a symlink in /tmp to point to a critical system file. This
   system file will be over written with the contents of the temporary
   file. For example ''[nobody $] ln -s /etc/passwd
   /tmp/persistent_state'' Then if root runs software utilizing the
   InstallAnywhere software (in my case it was LimeWire) the contents of
   /etc/passwd will be overwritten with the contents of persistent_state.
   The env.properties.NNNNN file appears to be created during the
   execution of InstallerData/makeExecutable/laxunix.sh The
   persistent_state file might be created during the execution of
   ./InstallerData/com/zerog/registry/UUID.class A basic check with
   'strings' leads me to believe this. Local attackers can exploit this
   vulnerability to clobber root owned system files, this could possibly
   lead to a denial of service or system compromise. If software utilizes
   InstallAnywhere v5.0.6 to perform system installation then you are
   vulnerable. I tested the enterprise edition that I downloaded from them
   for a free evaluation.
