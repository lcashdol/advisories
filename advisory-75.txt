   Description: Mambo is a full-featured content management system that
   can be used for everything from simple websites to complex corporate
   applications.
   Vulnerability:
   Clear text password/crypt: Mambo stores mysql database password in
   clear text in the documentroot path. (default recommendation is to use
   root credentials) which is readable by any local user. Mambo also
   stores the admin password hash which is readable by any local user.
