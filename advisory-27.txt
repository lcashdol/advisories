   Description: Bootstrap a machine. Install packages, create a deploy
   user, upload authorized keys and deploy key. Uses RVM to install
   desired rubies, with patch support.
   Vulnerability:
   From: ./cap-strap-0.1.5/lib/cap-strap/helpers.rb User supplied input
   isn't properly sanitized for #{user} and #{password} This can lead to
   command injection if this gem is used in the context of a rails
   application. Secondly the password is exposed to the process table
   listing. The password crypt hash is also going to have the same 'sa'
   salt every time. 022-def create_user(user, password) 23- unless
   user_exists?(user) 24- command = "useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/{user}"
   25: command << " -p `perl -e print crypt({password}, salt)`" unless
   password.empty? 26- command << " -m {user}" 27- run "{sudo} #{command}"
