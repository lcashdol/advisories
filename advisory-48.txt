   Description: Converts Email to PDF files.
   Vulnerability:
   The following lines pass unsanitized user input directly to the command
   line. A malicious email attachment with a file name consisting of shell
   meta characters could inject commands into the shell. If the attacker
   is allowed to specify a filename (via a web gui) commands could be
   injected that way as well. 218 cmd = "pdftk %s updateinfo %s output %s"
   %[pdf, infofile, tfile] 219 @log.debug('pdftk-command is ' << cmd) 220
   pdftkresult = system( cmd)
