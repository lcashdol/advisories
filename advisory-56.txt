   Description: Upload an image to Gyazo.com.
   Vulnerability:
   From: ./gyazo-1.0.0/lib/gyazo/client.rb If this Gem is used in the
   context of a rails app a malicious user may inject commands via
   #{imagefile} and #{tmpfile} using shell meta characters like ; and
   sending an escaped \". 0through the {imagefile} name if the raw option
   is not set. Also file names are time based and predictable leading to
   file clobbering vulnerabilities as the running process username. 57
   unless opts[:raw] 58 tmpfile =
   "/tmp/gyazo_upload_{Time.now.to_i}_{Time.now.usec}.png" 59 if
   File.exist? imagefile 60 system "sips -s format png \"{imagefile}\"
   --out \"#{tmpfile}\" > /dev/null" 61 end 62 end
