Description: BaseSpace Ruby SDK is a Ruby based Software Development Kit to be
used in the development of Apps and scripts for working with Illumina's
BaseSpace cloud-computing solution for next-gen sequencing data analysis. The
primary purpose of the SDK is to provide an easy-to-use Ruby environment
enabling developers to authenticate a user, retrieve data, and upload data/
results from their own analysis to BaseSpace.
Vulnerability:
The API client code passes the API_KEY to a curl command. This exposes the api
key to the shell and process table. Another user on the system could snag the
api key by just monitoring the process table. In the following code snippet:
bio-basespace-sdk-0.1.7/lib/basespace/api/api_client.rb # +headers+:: Header of
the PUT call. +trans_file+:: Path to the file that should be transferred. def
put_call(resource_path, post_data, headers, trans_file) return %x(curl -H "x-
access-token:{@api_key}" -H "Content-MD5:{headers['Content-MD5'].strip}" -T "
{trans_file}" -X PUT #{resource_path}) end # Deserialize a boolean value to a
Ruby object.
