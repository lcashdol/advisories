   Description: Oracle Exadata is the only database machine that provides
   extreme performance for both data warehousing and OLTP applications,
   making it the ideal platform for consolidating on private clouds. It is
   a complete package of servers, storage, networking, and software that
   is massively scalable, secure, and redundant. With Oracle Exadata
   customers can reduce IT costs through consolidation, store up to ten
   times more data, improve performance of all applications, deliver a
   faster time-to-market by eliminating systems integration trial and
   error, and make better business decisions in real time.
   Vulnerability:
   The oracle engineered solution contains two leaf switches and in larger
   installations a spine switch. The installation I worked with didn't
   have a spine switch, but the two leaf switches were configured with
   three logins with easily guessable passwords and a shadow file that was
   world readable. There are three accounts with easily guessable default
   passwords on the exadata inifiniband switches: ilom-admin,ilom-operator
   and nm2user. rux0r:~ meep0$ ssh ilom-admin@192.168.0.113 "cat
   /conf/shadow" The shadow file is world readable: [root@exad-1swib2 ~]#
   ls -l /conf/shadow -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 749 Dec 23 2011 /conf/shadow
