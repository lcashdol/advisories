Description: JSpec is a minimalistic JavaScript behavior driven development
framework, providing simple installation, extremely low learning curve,
absolutely no pollution to core prototypes, async request support, and
incredibly sexy syntax, tons of matchers and much more.
Vulnerability:
The install function creates unsafely a temp file in /tmp to store the download
of rhino.zip, a malicious local user could replace this file with one of their
own installing a modified jar file. If a remote user can control #{uri} they
can inject commands directly into the shell as no santization of the variable
is done. jspec-steventux-3.3.2.1/src/installables.rb: 145 def install 146 say
"... fetching #{uri}"; `curl #{uri} -o /tmp/rhino.zip 2> /dev/nu ll` 147 say
"... decompressing"; `unzip /tmp/rhino.zip -d /tmp` 148 say "... installing to
#{path}"; `mv /tmp/rhino1_7R2/js.jar #{path}` 149 end
