Title: xaviershay-dm-rails v0.10.3.8 mysql credential exposure
Author:Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0
Date: 2015-02-17
Download Site: https://rubygems.org/gems/xaviershay-dm-rails
Vendor:Martin Gamsjaeger, Dan Kubb
Vendor Notified: 2015-02-17
Vendor Contact: notreal@rhnh.net
Description: This gem provides the railtie that allows datamapper to hook into
rails3 and thus behave like a rails framework component. Just like activerecord
does in rails, dm-rails uses the railtie API to hook into rails. The two are
actually hooked into rails almost identically.
Vulnerability:
The problem is with the execute function exposing the user credentials to the
process table. Lines 169 - 177 in /datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-
rails/storage.rb: def execute(statement) system( 'mysql', (username.blank? ? ''
: "--user=#{username}"), (password.blank? ? '' : "--password=#{password}"), '-
e', statement ) end
CVE-2015-2179
JSON:Export
Exploit Code:
   1. $ while (true) do ps -ef |grep [p]assword; done
