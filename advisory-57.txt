   Description: IBM Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) is a strategic data
   server in the IBM Information Management Software portfolio that
   provides blazing online transaction processing (OLTP) performance,
   legendary reliability, and nearly hands-free administration to
   businesses of all sizes. IDS 10 offers significant improvements in
   performance, availability, security, and manageability over previous
   versions, including patent-pending technology that virtually eliminates
   downtime and automates many of the tasks associated with deploying
   mission-critical enterprise systems.
   Vulnerability:
   During installation the installserver script creates a file in /tmp
   called installserver.txt an unprivileged user can symlink this file to
   another file causing the target file have the contents of
   installserver.txt appened to it. vapid:/tmp# ls -l
   /tmp/installserver.txt lrwxrwxrwx 1 lwc lwc 11 Oct 1 18:27
   /tmp/installserver.txt -> /etc/passwd After installation the contents
   of installserver.txt was appened to /etc/passwd. The default file
   permissions of the installation package are too open, an unprivileged
   user can take advantage of an installation by a privileged user by
   injecting code into the installer script.
