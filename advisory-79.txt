   Description: Webbynode Deployment Gem
   Vulnerability:
   The following code located in:
   ./webbynode-1.0.5.3/lib/webbynode/notify.rb doesn't fully sanitize user
   supplied input before passing it to the shell via %x. Messages via the
   growlnotify command line can possibly be used to execute shell commands
   if the message contains shell meta characters. def
   self.message(message) if self.installed? and !$testing message =
   message.gsub(/\x1B\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[m|K]/, "")
   %x(growlnotify -t "#{TITLE}" -m "#{message}" --image "#{IMAGE_PATH}")
   end end The message.gsub regex strips ANSI encoded characters from the
   #{message} variable, it doesn't strip characters like ;&| etc. If the
   attacker can control the contents of #{message}, #{TITLE} or
   #{IMAGE_PATH} they can possibly inject shell commands and execute them
   as the client user.
