Description: Netscape is a common web browser available for multiple operating
systems.
Vulnerability:
During installation of Netscape 6.01a for Solaris 2.7/8 Sparc, I noticed the
file /tmp/admin.3842 was created with mode 644. As you already know if this
package is installed by root in multiuser mode a malicious user could use this
to overwrite system files etc.. Here is the dangerous code: # grep tmp
ns6install cat >/tmp/admin.$$ <<EOF /usr/sbin/pkgrm -n -a /tmp/admin.$$ $
{pkg}.* 2>&1 /usr/sbin/pkgadd -n -a /tmp/admin.$$ -d `pwd` $pkg 2>&1 A
temporary work around would be to shut the system down into single user mode,
clean out /tmp and then install.
