   Description: The Firebird(tm) database engine is derived from the
   InterBase(r) product currently owned by Borland. The documentation
   forInterBase v 6.0 applies also to the current FireBird release.
   InterBase documentation is available in Adobe Acrobat format from
   http://info.borland.com/techpubs/interbase/." The "information
   database" stored in the file isc4.gdb is read and writeable for all
   users with the default rpm installation of Firebird-1.0.3 for Linux.
   Vulnerability:
   [root@Fester interbase]# ls -l /opt/interbase/isc4.gdb -rw-rw-rw- 1
   root root 618497 Jun 8 14:44 /opt/interbase/isc4.gdb This file contains
   the password hashes and usernames for the firebird database. The
   passwords are hashed twice, once with the static salt "9z" and a second
   time with the returned crypt text minus the salt.
   crypt(&amp;crypt(user_password,"9z")[2],"9z") The PrimeBase SQL
   Database Server 4.2 stores passwords in clear text, and based on the
   installation users umask settings maybe readable by all local users.
   From the readme.txt file: "The Admin server will require you to enter
   your password in a text file called 'password.adm' (in the server
   folder), before you can continue. NOTE: This is the password for access
   to the Admin Server only." Depending on your umask settings (default
   022 for root) the "Admin Server" password maybe readable by local
   users. Also the password is not stored as a hash or encrypted. A
   malicious user could uses this password to access the web based
   administration server and compromise the system. The database also
   comes with a default "Administrator" account with no password, the
   documentation does recommend the installer set the Administrator
   password during installation. Recommendations: Store the password as a
   hash in a file read-only by the Admin Server. Disable the Administrator
   account until a password has been set for it. This is still a problem
   for the symlink attack during installation for the primebase products.
   See previous link above for more detal. They just changed the format of
   the filename to something just as trivial as a static filename. Not
   going to bother reporting or posting this. LOG="/tmp/PrimeBase_"`date
   '+%y%m%d%H%M'`".log" Just as easy to ln -s /tmp/PrimeBase_$date.log to
   /etc/shadow.
