   Description: Backup is a RubyGem, written for UNIX-like operating
   systems, that allows you to easily perform backup operations on both
   your remote and local environments. It provides you with an elegant DSL
   in Ruby for modeling your backups. Backup has built-in support for
   various databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors,
   encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It was built with
   modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.
