Description: The snap command is a diagnostic utlitiy for gathering system
information on AIX platforms. It can only be executed by root, but it copies
various system files into /tmp/ibmsupt/ under /tmp/ibmsupt/general/ you will
find the passwd file with cyphertext. The danger here is if a system
administrator executes snap -a as sometimes requested by IBM support while
diagnosing a problem it defeats password shadowing. /tmp/ibmsupt is created
with 755 permissions they may carry out a symlink attack and gain access to the
password file.
Vulnerability:
snap is a shell script which uses cp -p to gather system information. Data from
/etc/security is gathered between lines 721 - 727. Seeing that snap uses the /
tmp/ibmsupt/general directory someone may create the directory as a normal user
(tested on on AIX 4.2.1). The user may then do a touch on /tmp/ibmsupt/general/
passwd. Once the passwd file is created do tail -f /tmp/ibmsupt/general/passwd.
If in another session someone loggs in as root and ran snap -a - this will
cause the contents of the /etc/security/passwd to show up in tail command.
