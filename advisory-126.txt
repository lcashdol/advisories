   Description: Simple and lightweight plugin to add a "Download" button
   to your posts, pages or custom post types.
   Vulnerability:
   zip-attachments allows arbitrary file downloads because it doesn't
   check the download path of the requested file. In
   zip-attachments/download.php, there is no check to see if the file is
   outside of the intended download path: 8 if(isset($_REQUEST['za_file'])
   && !empty($_REQUEST['za_file'])){ 9 10 $file = $_GET['za_file']; 11
   $filename = $_GET['za_filename']; 12 13 header('Content-Type:
   application/zip'); 14 header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file)); 15
   header('Content-Disposition: attachment;
   filename="'.$filename.'.zip"'); 16 17 readfile($file); 18
   unlink($file); Any file readable by the httpd process can be
   downloaded.
