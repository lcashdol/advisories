   Description: Gem for interacting with the API of lingq.com. It's a
   language learning website, and it's pretty useful, but I want to be
   able to work on my flashcards offline. This gem is being written to be
   included in a desktop client (and maybe eventually a mobile client),
   but will certainly still be useful as a standalone api wrapper for
   other projects that want to interact with Lingq.com
   Vulnerability:
   From: ./lingq-0.3.1/lib/lingq/client.rb Line 46 exposes the lingq.com
   API key to the command line via #{@apikey} variable. If this Gem is
   used in the context of a rails application a remote user may be able to
   inject commands into the shell via special meta characters like ; and &
   as the variables are not sanitized. 08- attr_reader :target_language 9-
   attr_reader :languages 10- 11: def initialize(api_key) 12: @apikey =
   api_key 13- load_languages! 14- end 15- -- 43-
