   Description:
   Vulnerability:
   A quick note on Fastlink Software's TheServer http server. I was not
   going to write this up since it is a silly problem but this server is
   listed in the netcraft survey so people are using it. TheServer is a
   very small and simple webserver for the Windows platform it consists of
   a single executable and configuration file. TheServer stores the
   password for log file accesss in cleartext. This password is stored in
   the server.ini file. Which by default resides in the servers root
   directory. This is a VERY simple webserver for Windows 98/95 if the
   server is setup to log, then the password is also sent to the logfile
   when accessing the server logs remotely. The risk is you can have
   someone else parsing your weblogs that you never intended. Hello Larry;
   I'm the developer of TheServer. I've posted information about the
   security issue you wrote about on Security Tracker on my website at
   http://www.fastlinksoftware.com under the FAQ section. The information
   I posted is as follows: Q: How do I prevent people from downloading my
   SERVER.INI file and getting my system password? A: Make a folder below
   the root of your web pages and place SERVER.EXE and SERVER.INI there.
   Set the 'root' field in the SERVER.INI file to the folder where your
   web pages start. Add a 'restrict' line for the new folder you created.
   Example: Your web pages are in c:\web Make a folder called 'bin' under
   c:\web. Place SERVER.EXE and SERVER.INI in the 'bin' folder. Edit the
   SERVER.INI file and change the 'root' field as follows: root=c:\web Add
   a line in the SERVER.INI file that would appear as follows:
   restrict=bin With the above example when TheServer starts it will look
   for the starting web page in 'c:\web' and access will be restricted to
   the 'bin' folder that contains the SERVER.INI file. Thanks, Allen
   Rodgers.
