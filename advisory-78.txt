Description: OCE 9600 plotter is a printing hardware device
Vulnerability:
I apologize if this has be brought up before, but with the recent post
concerning the QMS 2060 printers and the length of time I have sat on this (4
months) I figured it should be released. I sent this information to OCE long
ago with no response. I am aware of the Intelligent Peripherals bulletin by
CIAC. http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/j-019.shtml I have a few plotters /
printers under my audit umbrella and noticed something interesting on an Oce'
9400 plotter. The printer has the ability to be a telnet proxy. Where as a user
can hop via telnet to other hosts. If the printer is not setup properly the
connections will go unlogged. bunyip% telnet JPP1 Trying 192.168.38.244...
