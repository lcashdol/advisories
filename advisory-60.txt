   Description: Midikeys is a sound editing program for SGI IRIX 6.x.
   Vulnerability:
   I have been auditing our IRIX boxes and found a new vulerability. This
   has been verified for IRIX 6.4 and 6.3 by other sources. Their has been
   a response from SGI here is the advisory. Aleph1 has compiled some very
   usefull information as well. On IRIX 6.5 systems (IRIX Release 6.5 IP28
   ) # uname -a IRIX64 devel 6.5 05190004 The setuid root binary midikeys
   can be used to read any file on the system using its gui interface. It
   can also be used to edit anyfile on the system, or execute a rootshell
   by changing your editor environment variable to a command in the CDE. I
   was able to get from guest account access to root access using the
   following procedure. Any local account will do. From an unpriviledged
   account (guest). devel 25% id uid=998 gid=998(guest) 2) Execute the
   midikeys application with display set to your host. devel 26%
   ./midikeys devel 27% Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display
   "grinch:0.0". Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display "grinch:0.0". 3)
   under the midikeys window click sounds and then midi songs. This will
   open a file manager type interface. 4) You can enter the path and
   filename of files you which to read. including root owned with
   group/world read/write permissions unset. 5) If you select a file like
   "/usr/share/data/music/README" it will appear in a text editor. Use the
   text editor to open /etc/passwd and make modifications at will. Save
   and enjoy. So I removed the '*' from sysadm... $ su sysadm # id
   uid=0(root) gid=0(sys) devel 28% ls -l /usr/sbin/midikeys -rwsr-xr-x 1
   root root 218712 Jan 10 17:19 /usr/sbin/midikeys I have tested this on
