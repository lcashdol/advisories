   Description: The PrimeBase Database Server is a relational Database
   Management System (DBMS) for Mac, UNIX and Windows platforms. The
   PrimeBase Database Server supports all common database access standards
   (PBT, SQL, ODBC, JDBC, PHP, Perl, RealBasic, EOF and DAL) and protocols
   (TCP/IP, Shared Memory and Appletalk)
   Vulnerability:
   Local attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to clobber root owned
   system files and modify software binaries. This could possibly lead to
   a denial of service or system compromise. 1. Poor use of temporary
   files during installation. I noticed the PrimeBase install script
   creates the following files in /tmp: [nobody $] ln -s /etc/shadow
   /tmp/PrimeBase.log Then if a malicious user has previous knowledge of
   the administrators installation of PrimeBase the contents of
   /etc/shadow will be overwritten with the contents of PrimeBase.log.
   LOG="/tmp/PrimeBase.log" echo "$str:[y/n]" | tee $LOG echo "PrimeBase
   Installation: $now" >> $LOG 2. Poor default file permissions. A
   malicious local user could manipulate the binaries for PrimeBase used
   by the administrator and execute arbitrary code. The attacker would
   need to wait until the Database was restarted or the system rebooted.
