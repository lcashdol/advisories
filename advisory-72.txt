Description: Lipsiadmin is a new revolutionary admin for your projects.
Lipsiadmin is based on Ext Js 3+. framework (with prototype adapter) and is
ready for Rails 2.+
Vulnerability:
The function method Attachment.run() is used to convert images ie resize,
create thumbnails etc by passing the user supplied filename as an argument to
various command line utilities supplied by ImageMagick. Shell meta characters
aren't sanitized allowing a remote user to inject commands into the shell via
';'. lipsiadmin-5.1.9/lib/data_base/attachment/attach.rb 74 def run(cmd, params
= "", expected_outcodes = 0) 75 command = %Q<#{%Q[#{path_for_command(cmd)} #
{params}].gsub(/\s+/, " ")}> 76 command = "#{command} 2>#{bit_bucket}" if
Attachment.options[:swallow_stderr] 77 output = `#{command}` 78 unless
[expected_outcodes].flatten.include?($?.exitstatus) 79 raise
AttachmentCommandLineError, "Error while running #{cmd}" 80 end 81 output 82
end From ./lib/data_base/attachment/geometry.rb: 15 # Uses ImageMagick to
determing the dimensions of a file, passed in as either a 16 # File or path. 17
